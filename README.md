# pyflosic
Python based Fermi-Löwdin self-interaction-correction  
Coding language: python3 
Licence: apache2 

The self-interaction error (SIE) is one of the mayor drawbacks of one of the most widley used electronic structure methods - density functional theory (DFT). Pederson et al. proposed a unitary invariant and numerical handsome method based on Fermi-Löwdin orbitlals self-interaction correction (FLO-SIC). We implemented this method using the modern PySCF electronic structure code as basis.   

## Installation 
You need a working pyscf installation on your system. 

## Note 
Please note that code is in the open beta testing phase now. If you determine any problem please dont hesitate to ask one of the developers.

## Authors 
The development of pyflosic started within the master thesis of Lenz Fiedler. Over the last year we had many updates and complete code re-writes by Sebastian Schwalbe (ase-backends etc.) and Torsten Hahn (verious speed up techniques). Our main testers are Kai Trepte and Sebastian Schwalbe. Our overall theoretical guideline and head of descions is Prof. Jens Kortus.
