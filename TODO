THIS CODE MAY NOT WORK!

Please see also the pre-merge in 

- port all tabs to 4 empty spaces (done SS, KT) 
- port all print statements to python3.0 (done SS, KT)

   -> AF (atomic forces) do not work in flosic_os.py
   -> double check indents in flosic_scf.py 

- please read all comments (started SS) 
- fforce.dat is only written while debug = True, because of automatic testing   

- compile the newest FG-NRLMOL version and check all nrl2py and py2nrl
